1. All config options ONLY support the values they say they do.
   
2. Anchor script can be disabled. Turn it off if you're having another script handle boat anchoring.

4. Units can be changed between Freedom Units ("Imperial") and something else ("Metric"). I don't know what a kilometer is so idk why you'd want that
